  <figcaption>CityBEM integrates GIS, archetypes, and 3D geometry into unified data arrays.</figcaption>
</figure>

This workflow captures the full input-management pipeline in CityBEM — from GIS preprocessing and archetype assignment to geometry extraction and simulation-ready data generation.

### 1.1 Geospatial Matching (QGIS)
!!! info ""
    🗺️ Integrates GIS building footprints with attributes such as height, land-use, construction year, and parcel data.

### 1.2 Archetype Assignment
!!! info ""
    🏢 Assigns thermal, material, occupancy, and HVAC characteristics to each building through archetype mapping.

### 1.3 3D Geometry Processing
!!! info ""
    📐 Computes surface geometry (area, tilt, azimuth, façade grouping, roof type) required for thermal and solar modeling.

### 1.4 Weather Data Preparation
!!! info ""
    🌦️ Converts hourly meteorological data to the simulation time step and prepares dynamic boundary conditions.

### 1.5 Citywide Building Data Arrays
!!! info ""
    🧩 Builds optimized internal arrays for storing building attributes and driving the transient heat/mass balance solver.

Together, these components form a cohesive workflow enabling CityBEM V2 to perform **large-scale, high-resolution UBEM simulations** with both computational efficiency and physical fidelity.

## 2. :material-database-import: Input Data Specification

CityBEM V2 operates using a structured collection of input files that define the full configuration of a city-scale building energy simulation.  
These files specify the **building inventory**, **archetype definitions**, **material and thermal properties**, **meteorological conditions**, and **simulation control parameters** required by the framework.

All input files must follow a consistent formatting standard to ensure reliable parsing and reproducibility:

- Mostly text format (`.txt`)
- Tab-separated values (recommended for clarity and compatibility)
- UTF-8 encoding
- A single header row followed by data records

This page provides a detailed description of each required input file, including its purpose, data structure, parameter definitions, and the consistency constraints enforced throughout the CityBEM workflow.

---

## 3. :material-cube-outline: Building Geometry Input

### 3.1 ASCII STL Geometry  

`Input_City_scale_geometry_CityBEM.stl`

<figure markdown>
  ![STL Geometry Input](assets/input_geometry_stl.png){ width="100%" loading=lazy }
  <figcaption>3D urban building geometry using SCII STL files</figcaption>
</figure>

---

### 3.2 Purpose

The geometry file defines the **3D building representation** for the UBEM domain in **ASCII STL** format.  
Each building must be stored as an individual `solid` block to ensure clean building separation and accurate surface reconstruction.

---

### 3.3 Coordinate system

CityBEM uses a well-defined right-handed coordinate system:

- **X-axis → East**  
- **Y-axis → Upwards (vertical)**  
- **Z-axis → North**

This convention must be followed when:

- Importing building models from external platforms  
- Aligning CityBEM with **CFD models**, **microclimate solvers**, or **GIS datasets**  
- Interpreting solar geometry (azimuth, altitude, incidence angles)

Maintaining consistent coordinates ensures that solar, shading, and thermal calculations operate correctly.

---

### 3.4 STL Structure

- Each building is represented as a `solid` block.  
- Inside each block, **triangular facets** define the building surfaces.  
- CityBEM performs a **triangle-grouping process** to reconstruct planar surfaces (walls, roofs, floor slabs).  
- Degenerate or non-planar triangles are automatically handled during preprocessing.

This structure enables robust geometry interpretation for large building stocks.

---

### 3.5 Preprocessing Workflow

CityBEM includes a geometry-preprocessing tool that can:

- Convert STL/OBJ models into the **CityBEM coordinate system**  
- Assign consistent `building_id` tags  
- Filter and remove non-building objects (terrain, vegetation, urban furniture)  
- Validate and repair geometry to ensure watertight surfaces  
- Prepare surface metadata required for solar and thermal simulation

This geometry file is foundational for:

- Computing envelope areas, surface normals, and orientations  
- Running roof/ façade solar radiation calculations  
- Performing **inter-building shading analysis**  
- Coupling with CFD/microclimate tools (CityFFD, OpenFOAM, etc.)

---

### :material-toolbox-outline: 3.6 Useful Tools

Below are recommended platforms to help users **generate, edit, or validate** building geometry before importing into CityBEM.

# 1. Building Stock Data

## 1.1 `Input_City_scale_building_info.txt`

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/input_building_info.png" alt="CityBEM Building Info Example" width="80%">
</div>

### Purpose

This file defines the **core metadata** for every building in the simulation domain. It acts as the **central index** that links:
- GIS/OSM geometry
- Archetype assignments (by year and usage type)
- Geospatial location for solar and weather processing

Each row corresponds to **one building**.

### Typical Columns and Their Roles

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `building_id` | Unique internal ID used by CityBEM (integer or string). This ID must be consistent across all input and output files referencing buildings. |
| `building_osm_id` | External GIS or OpenStreetMap identifier used for traceability and GIS post-processing. |
| `year_of_construction` | Construction year or representative vintage. Used to map the building to a **construction-year archetype** (thermal envelope properties, infiltration, etc.). |
| `usage_type_code` | Code that links the building to a **usage-type archetype** (occupancy, internal loads, schedules, HVAC). Must match IDs defined in `Input_City_scale_archetype_usage_type.txt`. |
| `longitude`, `latitude` | Geographic coordinates (WGS84). Used for solar position and potential external GIS operations. |

Depending on the case, additional columns can be included (e.g., number of floors, floor area), but the **minimum set** must at least allow:
- Unambiguous building identification
- Mapping to year and usage archetypes
- Providing a location in space (for solar and microclimate coupling)

### How CityBEM Uses This File

- Reads all building rows and constructs an internal **building list/array**.
- For each building:
  - Uses `year_of_construction` to select envelope properties from the **year archetype** file.
  - Uses `usage_type_code` to select operational and HVAC properties from the **usage-type archetype** file.
  - Links the `building_id` to geometric entities in the STL file based on the same ID or consistent naming.

**Consistency requirement:**  
All buildings referenced in other files (e.g., result selection, PV configuration, etc.) must use the same `building_id` defined here.

---

# 2. Archetype Libraries

Archetypes define **typical properties** for groups of buildings, instead of specifying every parameter per building. CityBEM V2 uses archetypes to keep simulations scalable at the **city level**.

The following files define different archetype dimensions:

- Construction year (envelope, infiltration)
- Usage type (internal loads, schedules, HVAC)
- Material composition (slabs, walls, construction materials)
- Energy sources (for operational GHG calculations)
- Internal heat gains

---

## 2.1 Construction Year Archetype  
### `Input_City_scale_archetype_year.txt`

</div>

### Purpose

This file defines **construction-year-based archetypes**, which capture how building envelopes and infiltration rates differ across vintages (e.g., pre-1945, 1945–1975, post-2000).

Each row corresponds to a **construction year class**, usually represented by:
- A year interval (e.g., 1945–1975) or
- A representative year (e.g., 1975)

### Main Data Blocks

1. **Infiltration (ACH)**  
   - Typical air change rates (ACH) for:
     - Winter conditions
     - Summer conditions
   - These values are used to estimate **air leakage** and its impact on heating/cooling loads.
   - ACH values are later converted to mass/volumetric flow rates based on floor area and ceiling height.

2. **Envelope Properties**  
   For each year archetype, the file includes parameters such as:

   - **U-values** (W/m²·K) for:
     - Roof
     - External walls
     - Ground floor/slab
     - Windows
   - **Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)** for glazing  
   - **Material properties** (effective values for simplified envelope layers):
     - Heat capacity (Cp, J/kg·K)
     - Density (ρ, kg/m³)
     - Effective layer thickness (m)
   - **Radiative properties**:
     - Shortwave absorptance (α) for walls and roofs
     - Longwave emissivity (ε)

These parameters directly influence:
- Heat transfer through the envelope
- Solar absorption on opaque surfaces
- Thermal mass effects during transient simulations

### How CityBEM Uses This File

- For each building, the `year_of_construction` from `Input_City_scale_building_info.txt` is mapped to a **year archetype row**.

  - HVAC efficiencies:
    - Seasonal performance factor (SPF) for heat pumps
    - Coefficient of performance (COP) for chillers or cooling systems

- **Envelope-related operational parameters**
  - Window-to-wall ratio (WWR) for typical façade design per usage type
  - Heated floor area ratio (fraction of building floor area that is conditioned/heated)

### How CityBEM Uses This File

- For each building, CityBEM:
  - Reads its `usage_type_code`
  - Assigns the corresponding internal loads, schedules, HVAC setpoints, and system efficiencies
- These archetypes determine:
  - Internal gains (occupants, lighting, appliances) as a function of time
  - The target indoor temperature for the HVAC control
  - Whether a zone is actively heated/cooled or allowed to float

This file is central to **operational behavior** and has a strong influence on:

### ⚙️ 4.5 How CityBEM Uses Weather Data

Weather inputs drive the physical models for every timestep in the simulation.

#### 1. Thermal Boundary Conditions
Used for:

- Surface heat balance  
- Indoor zone energy balance  
- Moisture balance (humidity, evaporation, infiltration)

#### 2. Solar Radiation Modeling
Provides:

- Horizontal and tilted plane irradiance  
- Direct + diffuse solar components  
- Inputs to shading models

#### 3. Wind-Dependent Models
Wind data supports:

- Infiltration + natural ventilation models  
- Microclimate coupling simulation (if enabled)

---

### 📝 4.6 Weather Data Summary

!!! note "🔧 Key Notes"
    - Must provide a **continuous time series** with a fixed time step  
    - Must include **sufficient weather variables**.  
      For example, **global horizontal irradiance (GHI)** is enough for solar modeling if other radiation terms are unavailable, and **air temperature + relative humidity (or dew point)** are sufficient since other psychrometric quantities can be derived.
    - The simulation time period must match the **valid period of the input weather data**  
    - The dataset must represent a **climate zone consistent with the study area**

# 5. Solar Position Input

## 5.1 Hourly Sun Position Data  
### **`Input_cosine_zenith.txt`**

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/input_cosine_zenith.png" alt="Cosine Zenith Example" width="50%">
</div>

---

### 🔍 5.1 Purpose

`Input_cosine_zenith.txt` stores **precomputed solar geometry parameters** that are required throughout the CityBEM simulation.  
By preparing these values in advance, CityBEM avoids repeated solar-position calculations, improving computational efficiency during shading and irradiance evaluation.

!!! info "Solar Position Resource"
    You can generate accurate sun-position values using the  
    <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/" target="_blank">NOAA Solar Position Calculator</a>.

**Notes:**
- **Hourly resolution is sufficient** for sun-position data because solar angles vary smoothly over time.  
- If the simulation timestep is **sub-hourly**, CityBEM will **extrapolate/interpolate solar-position values automatically**, ensuring accurate sun-direction inputs at all temporal resolutions.

---

### 📄 5.2 Typical Content

For each simulation timestep (typically hourly), `Input_cosine_zenith.txt` contains:

- **Cosine of the solar zenith angle**  
- **Solar azimuth angle** (north-based convention)

These parameters are generated during the preprocessing stage to ensure consistent solar geometry across the simulation.

---

### ⚙️ 5.3 Functional Role in CityBEM

The stored solar-geometry values are used throughout the solar and shading pipeline:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-timer: **Sub-Hourly Timestep Adaptation**  
  CityBEM automatically interpolates or extrapolates sun-position values when users select finer timesteps (e.g., 10-min or 15-min simulations).

- :material-white-balance-sunny: **Ray-Tracing Shading Support**  
  Supplies the sun-direction vectors, surface incidence angles, and other required inputs for the 3D shading engine.

- :material-ray-start: **Consistent Solar Geometry**  
  Ensures all buildings and surfaces across the city domain use a unified solar reference.

- Initializes the main simulation mode before any time-stepping loop is started.
- Determines which solvers, coupling schemes, and I/O routines are activated.
- Allows users to configure advanced workflows (e.g., coupled Urban Climate–Building Energy simulations) without changing the code.

## 5.2 City-Scale Simulation Settings  
### `Input_City_scale_settings.txt`

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/input_city_scale_settings.png" alt="CityBEM City-scale Settings Example" width="80%">
</div>

### Purpose

This is the **central configuration file** controlling city-scale simulation parameters.  
It defines **time controls**, **geographic parameters**, **building physics options**, and **optional add-ons**.

### Main Parameter Groups

#### 1. Time Controls
- Simulation start date and time
- Simulation end date or total duration
- Timestep size (seconds)
- Optionally, warm-up periods for stabilizing initial conditions

#### 2. Geographic Controls
- Latitude and longitude of the study area
- Time zone (e.g., UTC offset)
- Site elevation
- These parameters are used for:
  - Solar position calculation
  - Atmospheric corrections

#### 3. Building Physics Settings
- Number of wall and roof layers used in the conduction model
- Ventilation settings:
  - Infiltration model options
  - Mechanical ventilation rates (if globally applied)
- HVAC operation options:
  - Control strategy (e.g., thermostat-based, scheduled operation)
  - Operation mode flags (e.g., heating-season-only, cooling-season-only, or combined)

#### 4. Optional Add-ons
Flags and parameters to activate or configure:

- **Rooftop PV model**
  - Whether to simulate PV
  - Links to PV design inputs and shading models
- **Green roofs**
  - Whether green roof modules are activated
- **Shading model**
  - Whether detailed 3D ray-tracing shading calculations are used
- **Microclimate coupling**
  - Whether to use microclimate-adjusted boundary conditions from CityFFD or other tools

### How CityBEM Uses This File

- Read at initialization to:
  - Configure the internal solver structure
  - Set global constants and switches
- Every subsequent input file is interpreted **in the context** of these settings (e.g., time step, simulation period).

# 6. Result Selection

## 6.1 `Input_City_scale_result_selection.txt`

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/input_result_selection.png" alt="CityBEM Result Selection File" width="80%">
</div>

### Purpose

This file allows users to **control which variables** are written to the output files, reducing storage and focusing on relevant KPIs.

Each row typically represents one **output variable**.

### Typical Columns

- Variable index (internal ID used by CityBEM)
- Symbol or descriptive name (e.g., `Tzone`, `Q_heating`, `PV_power`)
- Print flag (Y/N) – whether to output this variable at all
- Transient output flag (Y/N) – whether to store time series for each timestep or only aggregate values

### Typical Variable Categories

- Indoor temperatures (air, mean radiant, surface)
- Thermal loads (heating, cooling)
- Humidity and moisture-related quantities
- Solar gains (per surface or per building)
- HVAC power and energy use by end use
- GHG emissions (operational and, if implemented, embodied)
- Rooftop PV outputs (power, energy, self-sufficiency indices, export/import flows)

### How CityBEM Uses This File

- During the simulation, only variables flagged for output are:
  - Computed at the detailed reporting level
  - Written to disk as time series or aggregated results
- This enables efficient handling of large-scale simulations (tens of thousands of buildings) without unnecessary I/O.

# ✅ Summary

This page documents all **input files** required to run CityBEM V2, the role of each file, and the main parameters controlling city-scale building energy simulations.

Before running a simulation, users should ensure:

- All input text files are:
  - Properly formatted (tab-separated, consistent headers)
  - Free of missing values in critical columns
- IDs and codes are **consistent across files**:
  - `building_id` matches between building info, geometry, and outputs
  - `usage_type_code` and year classes correctly map to archetype definitions
- Weather data fully covers the desired simulation period with a timestep consistent with the settings.
- Geometry is provided in CityBEM-compliant STL format, respecting the coordinate system.
- Result selection is carefully configured to capture required outputs without generating unnecessary data.

For concrete examples, sample files, and case studies, refer to the **Test Cases** section of the documentation.
